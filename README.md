# Predicting Which Passenger Survived the Titanic
This project is probably the rite of passage for everyone getting into data science. I never really enjoyed the movie, but the door could totally fit both Rose and Jack.
Although we know exactly who survived the Titanic, the project is still useful to apply important concepts in data science and machine learning. So here it is!

# Objective: Predict which passenger survived the Titanic (Jack died)
Techniques used:

* Pandas, matplotlib, numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Logistic regression, train_test_split, k-nearest neighbours
* Hyperparameter optimization
* Random forest classifier , Decision Tree , SVM , KNN etc

# Accuracy 94.5%
