# Titanic Prediction
# Predicting Which Passenger Survived the Titanic
This project is probably the rite of passage for everyone getting into data science. I never really enjoyed the movie, but the door could totally fit both Rose and Jack.
Although we know exactly who survived the Titanic, the project is still useful to apply important concepts in data science and machine learning. So here it is!

# Objective: Predict which passenger survived the Titanic (Jack died)
Techniques used:

* Pandas, matplotlib, numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Logistic regression, train_test_split, k-nearest neighbours
* Hyperparameter optimization
* Random forest classifier , Decision Tree , SVM , KNN etc

# Accuracy 94.5%


# Breast-cancer-risk-prediction

# Welcome to my GitHub repository on Using Predictive Analytics model to diagnose breast cancer.
## Objective:
# The repository is a learning exercise to:

* Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
* Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
* Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process.
* The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository

* Identifying the problem and Data Sources
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Pre-Processing the Data
* Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign

## Help in detecting breast cancer with 99.122% of accuracy
